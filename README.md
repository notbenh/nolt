# NOLT: notbenh's own life tools

In short this is just a small collection of some of the silly scripts
that I've built in order to keep my life in order. Figured I would share
as they might help some one else. 

There are a few things that should really be aliases though as I use
dmenu heavily in my general work-flow and it relies on items in $PATH
I have broken out a bunch of these as individual scripts that are little
more then a shell script that defines what would be the body of the
alias. This is what works for me but again please find what works best
for you and do that!
